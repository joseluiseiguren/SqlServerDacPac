# SqlServer Project (Dacpac)

The main goal is to publish database changes made in the project directlly to the database, without hell scripts

## Database Creation (Empty)
* Create an Empty Database
* Right Click -> Tasks -> Register Data-Tier Application
* On Application Name you have to put the Visual Studio Project Name

## Upgrade Database
* Right Click -> Tasks -> Upgrade Data-Tier Application
* You have to select the dacpac file generated by Visual Studio
* That's all :-)

# Visual Studio Project
To generate dacpac files, you have just to build the solution, and go to BIN folder
Other option is to create a database snapshot
* Right click on the project -> Snapshot 
* This will create also a dacpac file
